# The Equalify Handbook

## What is the purpose of a handbook?
Equalify's handbook is modeled after [Gitlab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) and contains comprehensive information about everything related to Equalify. By publishing our handbook publicly, we're fostering a culture of transparency and openness, and ultimately contributing to a more accessible internet for all.

## What is Equalify?

Equalify is a platform for managing website accessibility, focused on improving conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We offer a managed service at https://equalify.app/ and repositories in the [EqualifyApp organization](https://github.com/EqualifyApp/) on GitHub for users to create their version of Equalify. Users who create their version are encouraged to contribute to our open source codebase so that we can work together to make the web more accessible to everyone.

## What are Equalify's core values?

At Equalify, we believe that everyone should have access to internet tools and information. Our commitment to access is reflected in both our mission (100 million equalified accessibility issues by 2025) and our business practices, typified by this handbook. Additionally, much of our code is published under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). This license ensures that our software remains free and open for everyone to use, study, and modify. By making our code publicly available, we hope to inspire others to join our mission of making website accessibility more inclusive for all users. 

## Will this handbook evolve?
Yes! Equalify Inc. was founded recently (August 7, 2023). As we meet new challenges, this document will evolve.
